I have been [teaching web design](https://www.gestaltung.hs-mannheim.de/fakultaet/menschen/lehrbeauftragte/) at the university of applied sciences in Mannheim, Germany for 10 years. I'm working on putting my [class](https://github.com/oelna/hsma-int) [materials](https://github.com/oelna/hsma-html) [online](https://github.com/oelna/hsma-int-slides). I occasionally write [blog posts](https://oelna.de/blog/) about design, or unrelated things. I [toot](https://mas.to/@oelna) stuff. Some of my projects I put on Github, or [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/oelna). If you find any of it useful, [consider a contribution](https://github.com/sponsors/oelna). It's appreciated!

I do graphic and web design work at [Studio Richter](https://richter.studio)
